        <p>
          I am a <span>Responsive Designer & Developer</span> who thrives on
          visual storytelling. When I'm not working, pursuing side projects, or
          getting lost in the rabbit hole of blogs & books, I can be found
          traveling, hiking, and searching for new stories.

          I was born and raised in NYC, but <span>my real roots</span> reach to
          South America. I owe my travel bug to being a first generation
          American with family all over the world - we were always on the go!

          <span>My passion: </span> I LOVE music - it's one of the most powerful
          and diverse methods for expression & communication. In the meantime, I
          get my fix by going to lots & lots of concerts. I'm at 160 and
          counting!

          <span>A fun fact: </span>As a true New Yorker, I'm slightly
          embarrassed to say that I only learned how to ride a plain ol'
          stationary bike 1 year ago, and have yet to learn to drive. But, the
          real takeaway is that I'm learning!
